I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), supervised by Prof. [Angela Yingjun Zhang](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/). Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree from Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2021. I also work closely with Prof. [Xiaojun Yuan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=o6W_m00AAAAJ&hl=en) during my postgraduate and undergraduate studies.

My research interests lie in the next-generation wireless communication technologies, including but not limited to reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted communications, semantic/task-oriented communication, and wireless edge intelligence.

I am serving as the managing editor of OJCOMS.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
