I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. [Angela Yingjun Zhang](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/). Before that, I received the B.Eng. degree from Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2021. 
I work closely with Prof. [Xiaojun Yuan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=o6W_m00AAAAJ&hl=en) during my postgraduate and undergraduate studies.

My research interests lie in the next-generation wireless communication technologies, including but not limited to reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted communications, semantic/task-oriented communication, and wireless edge intelligence.

Since 2022, I have been serving as the Managing Editor of the [IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society](https://www.comsoc.org/publications/journals/ieee-ojcoms). I am also helping to run the WeChat Account [@IEEE_OJCOMS](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aY6VfkoohUiArpe72GSCuw). Thanks for following!
