== About me
I am a Research Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong.
I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2025, supervised by [https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/ Prof. Angela Yingjun Zhang].
Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from the Yingcai Honors College, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2021, advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o6W_m00AAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Xiaojun Yuan].
My research focuses on signal processing and machine learning for wireless communications, with a particular emphasis on the convergence of model-based algorithms and data-driven learning toward white-box and explainable AI solutions for future wireless networks.


== News
- \[12-2025\] I joined the Dept. of EEE, HKU, as a Research Assistant Professor. A new journey began!
- \[09-2025\] Our invited [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11207199 position paper] on score-based generative modeling for ISAC performance evaluation is accepted by JCIN.
- \[07-2025\] I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis! Heartfelt thanks to my supervisor, [https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~yjzhang/ Prof. Angela Yingjun Zhang], and to my committee members for their guidance, encouragement, and unwavering support.
- \[12-2023\] Honored to be recognized for my contribution as Managing Editor of the IEEE Open Journal of the Communications Society (2022–2023).
